Cleaned the dataset from URLS and extracted hashtags within the tweets.

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?
