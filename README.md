## Cleaning

Cleaned the dataset from URLS, emojis and other special characters. Cleaned text for natural language processing using tokenization, lemmatization. Extracted popular hashtags and mentions.

## Analysis
* Sentiment analysis with the vader library
* Analysis for both world wide data and US data only
* Analysis by month, city and time for the US data
* Wordclouds for popular hashtags, mentions and common words
* Classifying tweets into popular topics using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

## Conclusion
* Sentiment overall mostly stable, with more neutral and positive sentiment than negative
* Very popular topic with high polarity and anger

## Future Work
* Classifying tweets into climate believers and deniers
